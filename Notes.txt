On the second player, when they click on a pocket, the click is "mirrored" on the server
meaning that it is on the same side of the board but opposite position. It could
either be something weird with the way we are reading in click position though I
kinda doubt that. It could also be an issue with something in the game logic.
Possibly that it is not moving counterclockwise correctly.

I've also noticed that the stones do not wrap correctly. I wonder if the board is 
set up wrong.
