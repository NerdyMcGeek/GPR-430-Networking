How to Play:
1. After opening the client, enter IP adress to connect to server.
2. Next, enter your preferred username.
3. Finally, enter a lobby number 1-4 to join. Other players and spectators must join the same lobby as you in order to play/watch your game.
4. In the lobby, you are able to chat by pressing SPACE, typing your message, then pressing ENTER to send.
5. Once a second player joins the lobby, the game instantly starts and chat is disabled.
6. If it is your turn, left click on the pocket you would like to play and then right click to confirm.
7. If your last "stone" lands in your Mancala pocket you can play again.
8. The play then turns to the other player and this continues until one player runs out of stones on their side of the board.
9. The game will declare a winner and then end.
